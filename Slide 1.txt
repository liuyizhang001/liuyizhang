    <h1>What is 5S?</h1>
    <p>5S is a Japanese workplace organization methodology that can significantly improve safety, efficiency, and overall quality in your chemical manufacturing plant.</p>
    <p>5S stands for five key steps, each with a specific focus:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span class="s-icon">Seiri (Sort)</span> - Eliminate unnecessary items from the workplace.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="s-icon">Seiton (Set in Order)</span> - Arrange necessary items for easy access and use.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="s-icon">Seiso (Shine)</span> - Keep the workplace clean and tidy.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="s-icon">Seiketsu (Standardize)</span> - Maintain a consistent organization system.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="s-icon">Shitsuke (Sustain)</span> - Make 5S a continuous habit for everyone.
        </li>
    </ul>
